# The C Programming Language - Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M.Ritchie
This repository includes solutions to all exercises from this book.

C is a general-purpose programming language, which features economy of expression, modern control flow and data structures, and a rich set of operators. 

You can navigate the chapters directories  including the exercises of each chapter.

In addition in each chapter directory there are three directories named `example-programs` , `guide` and `lectures`.
The `example-programs` is a directory including all exercises already written and explained in the book as it explains consepts of the C programming language.

The `guide` directory includes the solution of the exercises written in the Guide Book that comes with the study kit for all students in The Open University.
You don't need to have the book as all exercises are written above each solution. 

The `lectures` directory includes the solutions of exercises mentioned in the lectures. The lectures of each professor may diffrienciate, as the exercises mentioned. I have used the lectures from semester 2021b.
